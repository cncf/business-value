# BVS Open Sourced Artifact Governance

*(draft still subject to change)*

The BVS open sourced artifact governance applies to all artifacts created by the BVS approved by the CNCF to be open sourced. 

## Principles

The BVS community adheres to the following principles:
* **Open**: All approved BVS artifacts are open source. 
* **Welcoming and respectful**: See [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
* **Transparent and accessible**: Changes to artifacts, repositories, and CNCF related activities (e.g. level, involvement, etc) are done in public.
* **Merit**: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical and editorial accuracy, merit, and alignment with project objectives. 

## Expectations from Contributors

Contributors regularly submit content, show up at meetings, participate in discussions, and engage with community members on Slack answering questions or helping out. 

## Becoming a Contributor

Anyone who regularly contributes content to the project and adds value to it is considered a contributor. 

## Expectations from Maintainers

Making a community project work requires input and effort from everyone. Maintainers should actively participate in Pull Request (PR) reviews. They are expected to respond to assigned PRs in a reasonable time frame, either providing insights or assigning the PR to other maintainers.

Maintainers must either be technical reviewers or editors and coordinate with one another to ensure each submission is reviewed for technical accuracy, voice and style, and persona targeted. 

Every maintainer is listed in the CODEOWNERS file, with their GitHub handle.

## Becoming a Maintainer

On successful merge of a significant PR, any current maintainer can reach to the author behind the PR and ask them if they are willing to become a maintainer.  

For new projects, interested individuals can reach out to the project leads and discuss their desire of becoming a maintainer. 

## Changes in Maintainership

If a maintainer feels they can't fulfill the "Expectations from Maintainers", they are free to step down.

The project leads will only forcefully remove a current maintainer if they fail to meet their responsibilities or adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Project Lead

Each open sourced artifact has one or two project leads.

Along with the CNCF, project leads have the final say in decisions concerning the artifact as long as it adheres to the guidelines as stated in the charter.

If the project leads decide to step down, one of the maintainers must be appointed as new project lead.

For new projects, project leads are those individuals who initiated the initiative and spearhead the effort.

## Decision-making process

Decisions are built on consensus between maintainers. Proposals and ideas can either be submitted for agreement via a GitHub issue or PR.

In general, we prefer that technical and editorial accuracy, as well as maintainer membership, are amicably worked out between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, get a third-party maintainer (e.g. a mutual contact with some background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede. If a dispute still cannot be decided, a CNCF representative has the final say to decide an issue.

The decision-making process should be transparent and adhere to the principles of the charter.
All proposals, ideas, and decisions by maintainers or the project lead should either be part of a GitHub issue or PR.

## BVS and CNCF

Open sourced BVS artifacts are CNCF projects. As such, they might be involved in CNCF (or other CNCF projects) related marketing, events, or activities. Any maintainer can help driving the BVS involvement.
