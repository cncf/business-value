## Introduction

This document describes the purpose and operations of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Business Value SubCommittee.
 
**The current situation**: With technology increasingly becoming a strategic differentiator, numerous tech decisions are now made in leadership and boardroom meetings. These decisions will have business implications for years to come and it is imperative that the business side understands the long term impact the adoption of different technologies and approaches have. We strongly believe that today's world calls for tech-savvy executives.
 
**Primary goal (audience)**: Provide the tools executives and business leaders need to understand the cloud native stack and the business value they provide to engage in productive discussions with their engineering teams. To date, much of the content produced with CNCF is catered towards a technical audience with a level of understanding of the cloud native ecosystem. In order for cloud native computing to truly be prolific, content for a business-minded audience should also be developed. 
 
**Secondary goal (audience)**: Educate non-technical people who either must or want to learn about the current cloud native developments. Possible new audiences are new sales and marketing hires of CNCF members in need to understand the ecosystem. Additionally, we will extend some resources to include technical 101s for technical people just getting started (similar to the chairs' TNS series on the CNCF landscape).
 
**How we will help**: We'll create artifacts and collateral to communicate this business value with a particular focus on CNCF projects.
 
To incentivize contributions, the CNCF will open source artifacts or artifact series that the BVS and CNCF deem compliant with this charter. For details, please refer to these FAQs.  

## Mission

* Communicate the concepts and value of the cloud native ecosystem to a broader audience 
* Provide business professionals with the tools they need to participate in meaningful conversations with their technical counterparts
* Help new CNCF members get up to speed with the cloud native ecosystem 
* Provide engineers just getting started with cloud native with technical introductions that are largely free of jargon and assumptions of pre-existing familiarity

## Content Guidelines
* Content must be vendor-neutral, objective, and reflect the current industry view on the topic
* Cloud native terms must be used in accordance with the CNCF glossary definitions and link back to them when appropriate
* When a new term is introduced that is not yet covered by the glossary, a PR for that term should be submitted. This will ensure that all key terms used in BVS material are properly vetted and agreed upon before they are widely used.

## Areas considered in Scope

We'll capture key areas to be covered and identify owners. Most likely, we'll want to repurpose content by translating it into multiple different media, such as blogs or articles, slide decks, infographics, or videos whenever appropriate and feasible.
