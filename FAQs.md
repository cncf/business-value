# Cloud Native Business Value Content

As described in the [CNCF Business Value Subcommittee (BVS) Charter](https://github.com/cncf/business-value/blob/main/CHARTER.md), the goal of the subcommittee is to create artifacts that educate executives, business leaders, and non-technical audiences on cloud native technologies and their business value.
The goal of the BVS is to open source artifacts allowing the community to improve and update them over time. Each open source artifact will be led by the team who initiated the effort and/or those who hold corresponding roles according to the BVS open sourced contributor governance. 

## FAQs

### I have an artifact idea. How do I get started?

Any BVS member can propose an idea during the monthly meeting. BVS members will evaluate it and, if deemed appropriate and compliant with the BVS charter by a simple majority, present it to the CNCF for approval. Once approved by the CNCF, you can start generating the content.

### How do I recruit volunteers for my artifact idea?

Any member can leverage the BVS channels:
* Recruit volunteers during the monthly BVS meetings
* Reach out to your peer in the BVS Slack channel
* Send an email to the mailing list

Members may also request a five-minute speaking slot during the marketing committee meetings to "pitch" their project and recruit volunteers.

### Does my project become an open source project as soon as it's greenlighted?

No, initially, each artifact will be a BVS initiative living on a Google Doc. Once you have a draft that is ready to be shared, you'll present it during the BVS meeting. If deemed ready by a simple majority, it will be sent to the CNCF who will ultimately decide whether it's ready to go on the CNCF repo and become an open source project.

### My artifact is going on a repo. What's next?  

The team spearheading the effort will lead this project and take on roles and responsibilities according to the BVS open sourced contributor governance.  

We encourage project leads to set up separate meetings with their contributors to collaborate. During the monthly BVS meetings, each project lead will provide a quick project update to ensure all BVS members are kept up to date with progress. These meetings are also a great opportunity to recruit more volunteers.

Once a project is completed, it will still need a core team of maintainers who'll ensure any update requests are approved and merged. Each artifact is a living document and will thus never be truly complete.

### My artifact wasn't approved. What are my options?

If your artifact wasn't approved it likely doesn't comply with the BVS mission as described in the charter. You can rework it so it does or select a different project that is a better fit. If you don't understand the reasoning, ask for more specific feedback.
